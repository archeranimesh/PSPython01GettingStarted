### By: Bo Milanovich ###

I am following the [Plural Sight's Python Track](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/python), an will try to finish all the course under this track to increase my understanding of the python language. I am not aware of any copyright issues, but will upload in [my Github profile](https://github.com/archeranimesh/) for the version control on my study.

This is a notes taking repository which will have code and my understanding of the course. Kindly mail me if there an issue with copyright will try to remove it.
